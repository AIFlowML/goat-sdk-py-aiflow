# GOAT Python SDK Test Results

## Test Run Details
- **Date**: 2024-12-21
- **Time**: 11:00:55+07:00
- **Environment**: Python Virtual Environment

## Test Results

### Initial Test Run Issues
The test suite encountered several dependency-related issues:

1. **Import Error**: Unable to import `get_abi_output_types` from `eth_utils.abi`
   ```
   ImportError: cannot import name 'get_abi_output_types' from 'eth_utils.abi'
   ```

### Required Actions
1. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - Need to resolve version conflicts between eth-utils and web3
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed in the virtual environment

### Next Steps
1. Update the project's requirements.txt to specify compatible versions
2. Review and update dependency management
3. Re-run tests after fixing dependency issues

### Test Coverage Areas
The test suite covers:
- NFT Plugin Tests
- SPL Token Tests
- Tensor Plugin Tests
- Core Functionality Tests
- Adapter Tests

### Pending Items
1. Resolve dependency conflicts
2. Complete test runs for all components
3. Document test coverage metrics
4. Address any failing tests

## Notes
- The test infrastructure is in place but requires dependency resolution before full test execution
- Base test classes have been created for NFT, SPL Token, and Tensor plugins
- Integration tests are pending successful dependency resolution
- **Market Data Tests**: âœ… PASSED
  - Successfully tested `test_get_recent_trades`
  - Retrieved and validated BTC trade data
  - Proper response format with all required fields
  - Clean API response with status 200
