# Project Implementation Status

## SPL Token Plugin

### Completed Components
1. SPL Token Service
   - Implemented `transfer_token_by_mint_address` method with proper transaction handling
   - Added error handling for transfer operations
   - Fixed transaction creation with required parameters

2. SPL Token Utils
   - Implemented `get_token_info_by_symbol` function
   - Implemented `get_tokens_for_network` function
   - Implemented `get_token_by_mint_address` function
   - Implemented `does_account_exist` function
   - Added comprehensive tests for all utility functions

### Tests
- All SPL Token utility tests passing
- Fixed test cases for token transfer operations

   - Updated field aliases for proper serialization
   - Added proper validation for numeric fields
   - Implemented all required models:
     - `SwapMode` enum
     - `SwapInfo` model
     - `PlatformFee` model
     - `RoutePlanStep` model
     - `QuoteResponse` model
     - `SwapRequest` model
     - `SwapResponse` model
     - `SwapResult` model

2. Jupiter Client
