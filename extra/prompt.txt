# Debugging Session Restoration Guide

I'm working on finalizing the SPL Token Service backend with enhanced logging capabilities. Here's our current state and requirements:

1. Current Progress:
- We have a working SPL Token Service with basic functionality
- We've identified issues with logging, particularly around AsyncMock objects
- We've made progress on fixing the `get_token_balance_by_mint_address` and `transfer_token_by_mint_address` functions

2. Core Requirements:
- Implement comprehensive logging across all SPL Token Service methods
- Logs should be written to the log directory with appropriate categorization
- Handle AsyncMock objects properly in logging statements
- Ensure all methods have proper error handling and logging

3. Specific Areas to Focus:
- Token balance retrieval
- Token transfers
- Account validation
- Error handling
- Transaction monitoring

4. Logging Requirements:
- Log all method entries and exits
- Log important parameters and state changes
- Log errors with full context
- Separate logs for different operations (service, test, transfer flow)
- Proper handling of objects in logging statements

5. Testing Requirements:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Test logging functionality
- Mock appropriate responses
- Validate error scenarios

Can you help me implement these requirements, starting with enhancing the logging system and then moving through each component systematically?

you said 

I see the issue now. The error is happening in get_token_balance_by_mint_address when trying to log the connection attributes using vars(connection). The connection is an AsyncMock object which doesn't have a __dict__ attribute.
Let's modify the get_token_balance_by_mint_address function to handle this case:


==================================================================== short test summary info =====================================================================
FAILED tests/plugins/spl_token/test_spl_token_unified.py::test_transfer_token_success - TypeError: argument 'blockhash': 'str' object cannot be converted to 'Hash'

TypeError: argument 'blockhash': 'str' object cannot be converted to 'Hash'

we are unifiey all test in the test_spl_token_unified this way more control
I see the issue now. The problem is that we need to mock the get_token_accounts_by_owner method on the connection object, which is used to find the token account. Let me update the mock:

start from here and only show 50 lines so we not finihs he memory 
python -m pytest tests/plugins/spl_token/test_spl_token_unified.py -v | tail -n 50

async def transfer_token_by_mint_address(
    self,
    parameters: TransferTokenByMintAddressParameters,
) -> Transaction:
    """Transfer tokens by mint address."""
    operation = "transfer_token_by_mint_address"
    logger.info(f"[{operation}] Starting operation")
    
    # Initialize blockhash
    blockhash = None  # Initialize blockhash to None or a default value

    try:
        # Get recent blockhash
        logger.debug(f"[{operation}] Step: Getting recent blockhash")
        blockhash_response = await connection.get_latest_blockhash()
        
        # Ensure blockhash is of the correct type
        blockhash = blockhash_response[0]  # Assuming blockhash is returned as a tuple or list

        # Create transaction
        logger.debug(f"[{operation}] Step: Creating transaction")
        message = Message.new_with_blockhash(
            [transfer_ix],
            self.wallet_client.keypair.pubkey(),
            blockhash  # Ensure this is of type Hash
        )
        transaction = Transaction.new_unsigned(message)
        transaction.sign([self.wallet_client.keypair])
        
        logger.info(f"[{operation}] Successfully created transfer transaction")
        return transaction

    except Exception as e:
        log_error_details(operation, e, "transferring tokens")
        raise

        loook this code if it make sense to solve
