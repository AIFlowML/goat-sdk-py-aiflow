# GOAT SDK Python Translation Project Status

## Project Context
This document tracks the progress of translating the GOAT SDK from TypeScript to Python. While maintaining all functionality, we're prioritizing Solana-related components first. The translation aims to maintain full functionality while adhering to Python best practices, including proper error handling, logging, and comprehensive testing.

## Important Notes
- ALWAYS use the project's virtual environment at /Users/ilessio/dev-agents/mode_hack/goat/python_goat/venv
- DO NOT use conda environment
- Before any Python operations:
  - Deactivate conda: `conda deactivate`
  - Activate venv: `source /Users/ilessio/dev-agents/mode_hack/goat/python_goat/venv/bin/activate`

## Required Actions
1. Move TypeScript code to root directory
2. Clean up duplicate implementations
3. Ensure consistent error handling
4. Fix remaining test failures
5. Verify all imports work after reorganization

## Root Directory Structure
All Python work must be contained within: /Users/ilessio/dev-agents/mode_hack/goat/python_goat/
TypeScript code will be moved to: /Users/ilessio/dev-agents/mode_hack/goat/typescript/

## Test Status
Current test status after fixes:
1. test_get_token_balance_by_mint_address: âœ… Fixed
2. test_transfer_token_by_mint_address: âœ… Fixed
3. test_convert_to_base_unit: âœ… Fixed
4. test_tensor_client: âœ… Fixed

## History Cleanup Required
The codebase has accumulated multiple implementations of the same functionality, leading to conflicts and test failures. We need to:
1. Remove duplicate method implementations
2. Consolidate error handling
3. Clean up inconsistent async/sync patterns

### Restart Plan for Hyperliquid Implementation

Based on the user's original implementation in `/goat_sdk/plugins/hyperliquid/old-code`, we need to:

1. Restructure Implementation
   - Remove current ETH-based implementation
   - Follow the toolkit pattern from original code:
     * HyperliquidTool base class
     * OrderManagementTool for orders
     * AccountTool for account operations
     * MarketTool for market data
   - Use API keys directly without ETH dependency
   - Keep the same error handling patterns

2. Test Structure Alignment
   - Follow the original test organization:
     * test_toolkit.py for base functionality
     * test_order_tools.py for order operations
     * test_account_tools.py for account operations
     * test_market_tools.py for market data
     * test_agents.py for higher-level operations
   - Use the same fixtures and mocks from conftest.py
   - Maintain the same test coverage patterns

3. Implementation Steps
   - Step 1: Implement HyperliquidTool base class
   - Step 2: Add OrderManagementTool
   - Step 3: Add AccountTool
   - Step 4: Add MarketTool
   - Step 5: Implement error handling and retries
   - Step 6: Add comprehensive tests
   - Step 7: Verify all functionality matches original

4. Testing Approach
   - Use pytest fixtures from original implementation
   - Mock Hyperliquid API responses
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Verify retry mechanisms
   - Ensure proper async/await patterns

5. Documentation
   - Update API documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Document error handling
   - Include configuration guide

This restart will ensure we maintain the same functionality and patterns as the original implementation while providing a clean, well-tested codebase.
